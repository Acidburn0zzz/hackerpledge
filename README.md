The Hacker Pledge v0.2
======================

This document is a list of pledges that a company is willing to make to its engineers so they can thrive and continue developing their skills, to their common benefit.

This is a living, versioned document based on broad consensus from a community of hackers. Following this guide can ensure you that your technical team is happy and doing the best work they can.


The pledges
===========

As a company, we pledge to support:

 1. **Curiosity & initiative**

  Creativity is a critical part of programming and needs to be stimulated. Specifically, hackers should be encouraged to:

   * Read technological news & keep their skills up-to-date
   * Spend some time to explore new technologies and contribute some product ideas.
   * Attend a few conferences a year on their work time.

 2. **High-productivity working conditions**

   * Hackers should have the freedom to choose their tools, while they remain compatible with collaboration.
   * The best tools available should be used as they contribute a lot to productivity and happiness.
   * This applies to both hardware & software tools.
   * A quiet and stress-free environment should be maintained.

 3. **Openness & freedom of speech**

  Sharing ideas and knowledge about technological details should be encouraged:
   * Internally, in meetings and presentations
   * Externally, through meetups with other hackers, provided confidential aspects are agreed upon and respected.

 4. **Giving back to the community**

  Every company using Open Source Software owes a lot to the community. Ways to give back include:

   * Open-sourcing some internal projects
   * Sponsoring projects, meetups or conferences
   * Supporting community organizations


F.A.Q
=====

**Does this pledge have legal status?**

No. Still, it represents a strong, public commitment towards a hacker-friendly culture in the workplace.

**As a company, how do I support the pledge?**

We will announce an "official" protocol to publicly support the pledge, with a directory of companies having done so. It will probably consist of a tweet sent from the official company account and possibly a badge.

In the meantime, please contact us at contact@dotconferences.eu to be among the launch companies.

**As a hacker, how do I support the pledge?**

About the same. We should work on a good wording for a tweet to show support, something like "I would strongly prefer working in a company supporting the Hacker Pledge".

**Why did you create this pledge?**

As conference organizers (http://dotconferences.eu), we often see cases where companies are not educated towards the benefits of rewarding curiosity, initiative and openness of their engineers. We think it is mutually beneficial to have a hacker-friendly workplace and we hope to set a baseline for what this actually means.

**Shouldn't inclusiveness and non-discrimination be part of the pledge?**

Everyone (not just hackers!) should be treated without discrimination regarding gender, ethnic minority or beliefs. This pledge only tries to cover the hacker-specific points.


How to contribute
=================

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome all contributions directly on GitHub as Pull Requests. Please explain the rationale behind your ideas a bit more than you would for a regular PR though ;)

(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)

We will get a panel of highly respected hackers to act as moral authority in case of unresolved debates.
