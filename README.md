The Hacker Pledge v0.2
======================

This document is a list of pledges that a company is willing to make to its engineers so they can thrive and continue developing their skills, to their common benefit.

This is a living, versioned document based on broad consensus from a community of hackers. Following this guide can ensure you that your technical team is happy and doing the best work they can.


The pledges
===========

As a company, we pledge to support:

 1. **Curiosity & initiative**

  Creativity is a critical part of programming and should be stimulated by regularly reading tech news, exploring new software, attending a few conferences a year and keeping skills up-to-date. Hackers are expected to contribute product ideas and challenge the status quo.

 2. **High-productivity working conditions**

  Hackers should be free to choose the best tools available, both software and hardware. To avoid interrupts, their environment should be as quiet and stress-free as possible.

 3. **Openness & freedom of speech**

  Provided confidential aspects of the company business are agreed upon, sharing ideas and knowledge about technology should be encouraged both internally and externally through meetups and exchanges with other hackers.

 4. **Giving back to the community**

  Every company using Free Software owes a lot to the community and should try to give back by open-sourcing internal projects, sponsoring meetups or conferences, and supporting community organizations.


F.A.Q
=====

**Does this pledge have legal status?**

No. Still, it represents a strong, public commitment towards a hacker-friendly culture in the workplace.

**What is the value of this pledge?**

Supporting this pledge means two things for a company:
 * it shares most of the values of the hacker community.
 * it is actually capable of coming out publicly to support them. Most large companies sunk in bureaucracy wouldn't be able to.

**As a company, how do I support the pledge?**

We will announce an "official" protocol to publicly support the pledge, with a directory of companies having done so. It will probably consist of a tweet sent from the official company account and possibly a badge.

In the meantime, please contact us at contact@dotconferences.eu to be among the launch companies.

**As a hacker, how do I support the pledge?**

About the same. We should work on a good wording for a tweet to show support, something like "I would strongly prefer working in a company supporting the Hacker Pledge".

**Why did you create this pledge?**

As conference organizers (http://dotconferences.eu), we often see cases where companies are not educated towards the benefits of rewarding curiosity, initiative and openness of their engineers. We think it is mutually beneficial to have a hacker-friendly workplace and we hope to set a baseline for what this actually means.

**Shouldn't inclusiveness and non-discrimination be part of the pledge?**

Everyone (not just hackers!) should be treated without discrimination regarding gender, ethnic minority or beliefs. This pledge only covers hacker-specific points.

**Why don't you mention comfortable chairs?**

Same reason. The health of a hacker is not more valuable than any other employee.

How to contribute
=================

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome all contributions directly on GitHub as Pull Requests. Please explain the rationale behind your ideas a bit more than you would for a regular PR though ;)

(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)

We will get a panel of highly respected hackers to act as moral authority in case of unresolved debates.
