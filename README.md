The Hacker Pledge v0.3
======================

This document describes a pledge that a company is willing to make to its engineers so they can thrive and continue developing their skills, to their common benefit.

This is a living document based on a broad consensus from a community of hackers. We believe that taking the pledge and following its principles will help technical teams be happy and do the best work they can.


The pledge
==========

As a company, we pledge to support:

 1. **Initiative & curiosity**

  We expect hackers to be creative, contribute product ideas, and challenge the status quo. We encourage them to read tech news, explore new software, and attend a few conferences a year on their work time to keep their skills up-to-date.
  
 2. **High-productivity working conditions**

  We let hackers choose the best tools available, both software and hardware. To avoid interrupts and foster high-quality work, we strive to provide an environment as calm and stress-free as possible.
  
 3. **Openness & freedom of speech**

  We encourage our staff to share ideas and knowledge about technology through meetups and exchanges with other hackers,  while respecting the company's expectations for confidentiality.

 4. **Giving back to the community**

  Given how essential Free Software is to a hacker's work, we strive to give back by contributing upstream, open-sourcing internal projects, and sponsoring conferences or community organizations.


F.A.Q
=====

**Does this pledge have legal status?**

No. Still, it represents a strong public commitment towards a hacker-friendly culture in your workplace.

**So what is the value of this pledge?**

Supporting this pledge means two things for a company:
 * it shares most of the values of the hacker community.
 * it is actually capable of coming out publicly to support them. Some large companies sunk in bureaucracy wouldn't be able to.

**As a company, how do I support the pledge?**

You just have to send a tweet from your official company account! Recommended wording is:
 
 We support the @hackerpledge to provide a great environment for our engineers! http://hackerpledge.org
 
After doing so you will be added to a public directory of companies supporting the pledge. Check http://hackerpledge.org for updates!

**As a hacker, how do I support the pledge?**

Spread the word! Tweeting that you would strongly prefer working in a company supporting the @hackerpledge would really be helpful :)

**Why did you create this pledge?**

As conference organizers (we run http://dotconferences.eu), we often see companies where executives are not educated towards the benefits of rewarding curiosity, initiative and openness with their engineers. We think it is mutually beneficial to have a hacker-friendly workplace and we hope to set a baseline for what this actually means.

**Shouldn't inclusiveness and non-discrimination be part of the pledge?**

Everyone (not just hackers!) should be treated without discrimination regarding gender, ethnic minority or beliefs. This pledge only covers hacker-specific principles.

**Why don't you mention comfortable chairs?**

Same reason. The health of a hacker is not more valuable than any other employee!

**Who can I contact if I have feedback or questions on the Hacker Pledge?**

You can tweet to @hackerpledge or email us at contact@hackerpledge.org

How to contribute
=================

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome all contributions directly on GitHub as Pull Requests. Please explain the rationale behind your ideas a bit more than you would for a regular PR though ;)

(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)

We will get a panel of highly respected hackers to act as moral authority in case of unresolved debates.
