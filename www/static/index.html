                <h2>The Hacker Pledge v0.3</h2>
                <p>This document describes a pledge that a company is willing to make to its engineers so they can thrive and continue developing their skills, to their common benefit.</p>
                <p>This is a living document based on a broad consensus from a community of hackers. We believe that taking the pledge and following its principles will help technical teams be happy and do the best work they can.</p>

                    <h2>The Pledge</h2>
                    <p>As a company, we pledge to support:</p>

                    <h3>Initiative &amp; curiosity</h3>

                    <p class="subpledge">We expect hackers to be creative, contribute product ideas, and challenge the status quo. We encourage them to read tech news, explore new software, and attend a few events a year on their work time to keep their skills up-to-date.</p>

                    <h3>High-productivity working conditions</h3>

                    <p class="subpledge">We let hackers choose the best tools available, both software and hardware. To avoid interrupts and foster high-quality work, we provide an environment as calm and stress-free as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Openness &amp; freedom of speech</h3>

                    <p class="subpledge">We encourage our staff to share ideas and knowledge about technology through meetups and exchanges with other hackers, while respecting the company's expectations for confidentiality.</p>

                    <h3>Giving back to the community</h3>

                    <p class="subpledge">Given how essential Free Software is to a hacker's work, we strive to give back by contributing upstream, open-sourcing internal projects, and sponsoring conferences or community organizations.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Does this pledge have legal status?</h3>

                <p>No. Still, it represents a strong public commitment towards a hacker-friendly culture in your workplace.</p>

                <h3>So what is the value of this pledge?</h3>

                <p>Supporting this pledge means two things for a company:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>it shares most of the values of the hacker community.</li>
                    <li>it is actually capable of coming out publicly to support them. Some large companies sunk in bureaucracy wouldn't be able to.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>As a company, how do I support the pledge?</h3>

                <p>You just have to send a tweet from your official company account! Recommended wording is:</p>

                <blockquote>We support the @hackerpledge to provide a great environment for our engineers! http://hackerpledge.org</blockquote>

                <p>After doing so you will be added to a public directory of companies supporting the pledge. Check http://hackerpledge.org for updates!</p>

                <h3>As a hacker, how do I support the pledge?</h3>

                <p>Spread the word! Tweeting that you would strongly prefer working in a company supporting the @hackerpledge would really be helpful :)</p>

                <h3>Why did you create this pledge?</h3>

                <p>As conference organizers (we run http://dotconferences.eu), we often see companies where executives are not educated towards the benefits of rewarding curiosity, initiative and openness with their engineers. We think it is mutually beneficial to have a hacker-friendly workplace and we hope to set a baseline for what this actually means.</p>

                <h3>Shouldn't inclusiveness and non-discrimination be part of the pledge?</h3>

                <p>Everyone (not just hackers!) should be treated without discrimination regarding gender, ethnic minority or beliefs. This pledge only covers hacker-specific principles.</p>

                <h3>Why don't you mention comfortable chairs?</h3>

                <p>Same reason. The health of a hacker is not more valuable than any other employee!</p>

                <h3>Who can I contact if I have feedback or questions on the Hacker Pledge?</h3>

                <p>You can tweet to @hackerpledge or email us at contact@hackerpledge.org</p>
